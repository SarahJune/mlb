This file is the beginning of a class assignment to demonstate objects and their contruction. With pitchers and catchers reporting in a little over a week, I'm trying to create a simple baseball almanac.

As of, 2/10/15, I've covered the AL West: Mariners, Athletics, Rangers, Astros, and Angels.

The numbers for stats and dates have all been sourced from Wikipedia.

Methods:
  Inherited from MlbBaseball prototype:
  briefHistory() = states how many times a given team has won their division, the Pennant, and The World Series.

From the work I've done so far I've realized how immensely objects can increase the scope of a program. I've also learned that working with objects can lead you down a rabbithole and that you have to focus on what the objects are directly responsible for (objects within objects within objects...ugh).
